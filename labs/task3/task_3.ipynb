    "# Task 3: Decrypting a Message (Decapsulation & Symmetric Decryption)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completing this task, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Understand the role of the recipient** in a public-key cryptosystem when receiving an encrypted message.\n",
    "2.  **Apply** the concept of **Key Decapsulation** using ML-KEM and the recipient's private key to securely retrieve a shared secret.\n",
    "3.  **Recognize** that successful decapsulation using the correct private key and encapsulated key yields the *same* shared secret that the sender originally generated.\n",
    "4.  **Understand** how this retrieved shared secret, along with the nonce from the sender, is used with a **symmetric cipher** (AES-GCM) to decrypt the message.\n",
    "5.  **Identify** that if any of the inputs (private key, encapsulated key, nonce, or encrypted message) are incorrect or mismatched, decryption will fail.\n",
    "6.  **Interact** with the Python script to perform decapsulation and symmetric decryption.\n",
    "7.  **Verify** the integrity and confidentiality of the communication by successfully retrieving the original plaintext message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Task and the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "As the recipient, you have received three pieces of information from the sender (Task 2):\n",
    "1.  The **Encapsulated Key** (`ciphertext_kem`).\n",
    "2.  The **Nonce** (for AES-GCM).\n",
    "3.  The **Encrypted Message** (ciphertext from AES-GCM).\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have your **Private Key** from Task 1. Your goal is to use these items to recover the original plaintext message.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Key Decapsulation (ML-KEM):** You'll use your **private key** and the sender's **Encapsulated Key** (`ciphertext_kem`). The ML-KEM decapsulation process will \"open\" the `ciphertext_kem`. If successful (i.e., if your private key is the correct counterpart to the public key used by the sender for encapsulation), this process will yield the *exact same* shared secret that the sender generated in Task 2.\n",
    "2.  **Symmetric Decryption (AES-GCM):** Once you have recovered the shared secret, you'll use it as the key for AES-GCM, along with the **Nonce** provided by the sender, to decrypt the **Encrypted Message**. If the key, nonce, and encrypted message are all correct and untampered, AES-GCM will return the original plaintext message. AES-GCM also provides authentication, meaning it can detect if the ciphertext was modified after encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decryption Process (`on_decrypt_button_clicked` function):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Input Validation:** Checks if all required fields are filled.\n",
    "*   **Decode Inputs:** All Base64 encoded inputs (private key, encapsulated key, nonce, encrypted message) are decoded back into their raw byte formats.\n",
    "*   **KEM Decapsulation:**\n",
    "    *   `with oqs.KeyEncapsulation(selected_kem_alg, private_key_bytes) as kem_for_decapsulation:`: Initializes a KEM object. Crucially, the `private_key_bytes` are provided directly to the constructor. This \"primes\" the KEM object with your secret key.\n",
    "    *   `shared_secret_kem = kem_for_decapsulation.decap_secret(ciphertext_kem_bytes)`: This is the core decapsulation operation. It uses the private key (now part of `kem_for_decapsulation`) to process `ciphertext_kem_bytes`. If successful, `shared_secret_kem` will hold the symmetric key. If it fails (e.g., wrong private key, corrupted ciphertext_kem), an error will be raised by `liboqs`.\n",
    "*   **Symmetric Decryption (AES-256-GCM):**\n",
    "    *   `aes_key = shared_secret_kem`: The recovered shared secret is used as the AES key.\n",
    "    *   `aesgcm = AESGCM(aes_key)`: Initializes the AES-GCM cipher.\n",
    "    *   `decrypted_payload_bytes = aesgcm.decrypt(nonce_bytes, encrypted_message_bytes, None)`: Attempts to decrypt the message. If the key is wrong, the nonce is incorrect, or the `encrypted_message_bytes` have been tampered with, this will raise an exception (commonly `InvalidTag` for AES-GCM).\n",
    "    *   The successfully decrypted bytes are then decoded from UTF-8 back into a string.\n",
    "*   **Display Output:** The decrypted plaintext message is shown. Error messages are displayed in the status area if any step fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Interaction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Run the Python code cell below.\n",
    "2.  From the **ML-KEM Algorithm** dropdown, select the *exact same algorithm variant* used in Task 1 and Task 2.\n",
    "3.  Go back to your Task 1 output. Carefully copy the entire **Base64 encoded Private Key**. Paste it into the \"Your Private Key (Base64)\" text area in Task 3.\n",
    "4.  Go back to your Task 2 output. Carefully copy the **Base64 encoded Encapsulated Key**, **Nonce**, and **Encrypted Message**. Paste each of these into their corresponding text areas in Task 3.\n",
    "5.  Click the \"Decrypt Message\" button.\n",
    "6.  If all inputs were correct, you should see the original message you typed in Task 2 appear in the \"Decrypted Message\" area.\n",
    "7.  Read the status messages to follow the steps. Try deliberately pasting an incorrect private key or modifying one of the inputs from Task 2 to see how the decryption fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see your original message from Task 2 correctly decrypted, you have successfully completed the entire key generation, encapsulation, symmetric encryption, decapsulation, and symmetric decryption cycle using a Post-Quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanism! This demonstrates the fundamental flow of how PQC KEMs are used to secure communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Now, run the code cell below to perform Task 3.**"
