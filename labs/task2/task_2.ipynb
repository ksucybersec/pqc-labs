    "# Task 2: Encrypting a Message (Encapsulation & Symmetric Encryption)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time: 15-20 minutes**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completing this task, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Understand the role of the sender** in a public-key cryptosystem.\n",
    "2.  **Apply** the concept of **Key Encapsulation (KEM)** using ML-KEM and a recipient's public key to securely generate a shared secret.\n",
    "3.  **Recognize** that the KEM process produces two main outputs: an **encapsulated key (ciphertext)** to be sent to the recipient, and the **shared secret** itself (kept by the sender for immediate use).\n",
    "4.  **Understand** how the KEM-derived shared secret is used as a key for a **symmetric cipher** (like AES-GCM) to encrypt the actual message.\n",
    "5.  **Identify** the components needed for AES-GCM encryption: a key and a nonce (Number used ONCE).\n",
    "6.  **Interact** with the Python script to perform encapsulation and symmetric encryption.\n",
    "7.  **Prepare** the necessary outputs (encapsulated key, nonce, encrypted message) for the recipient (Task 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Task and the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In this \"sender\" role, your goal is to encrypt a message so that only the recipient (who has the corresponding private key from Task 1) can decrypt it. We achieve this using a hybrid approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Key Encapsulation (ML-KEM):** You'll use the recipient's **public key** (from Task 1) to generate a fresh, random symmetric key (the \"shared secret\"). Simultaneously, ML-KEM \"encapsulates\" this shared secret. This encapsulation process creates a ciphertext (let's call it `ciphertext_kem` or \"encapsulated key\") that can only be \"decapsulated\" (opened) by the recipient using their private key to retrieve the same shared secret.\n",
    "2.  **Symmetric Encryption (AES-GCM):** Once you have the `shared_secret_kem`, you'll use it as the key for a highly efficient and secure symmetric encryption algorithm called AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode). AES-GCM will encrypt your actual plaintext message. AES-GCM also requires a \"nonce\" (a number used once), which must be unique for every message encrypted with the same key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encryption Process (`on_encrypt_button_clicked` function):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Input Validation:** Checks if an algorithm is selected, a public key is provided, and a message is entered.\n",
    "*   **Decode Public Key:** The Base64 encoded public key from Task 1 is decoded back into its raw byte format.\n",
    "*   **KEM Encapsulation:**\n",
    "    *   `with oqs.KeyEncapsulation(selected_kem_alg) as kem:`: Initializes the KEM.\n",
    "    *   `ciphertext_kem, shared_secret_kem = kem.encap_secret(public_key_bytes)`: This is the core KEM operation.\n",
    "        *   `public_key_bytes`: The recipient's public key.\n",
    "        *   `ciphertext_kem`: The encapsulated shared secret. This is what you'll send to the recipient.\n",
    "        *   `shared_secret_kem`: The actual shared secret (a 32-byte value for Kyber/ML-KEM). This is *not* sent directly but used immediately to encrypt the message.\n",
    "*   **Symmetric Encryption (AES-256-GCM):**\n",
    "    *   `aes_key = shared_secret_kem`: The shared secret from ML-KEM is used as the AES key.\n",
    "    *   `nonce = os.urandom(12)`: Generates a random 12-byte nonce. This nonce is critical for AES-GCM's security and must also be sent to the recipient (unencrypted).\n",
    "    *   `aesgcm = AESGCM(aes_key)`: Initializes the AES-GCM cipher.\n",
    "    *   `encrypted_message_bytes = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plaintext_bytes, None)`: Encrypts the plaintext message.\n",
    "*   **Prepare Outputs:** The `ciphertext_kem`, `nonce`, and `encrypted_message_bytes` are all Base64 encoded for easy display and copying. These are then shown in their respective output text areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Interaction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Run the Python code cell below.\n",
    "2.  From the **ML-KEM Algorithm** dropdown, select the *exact same algorithm variant* that you (or the \"recipient\") used in Task 1 to generate the key pair.\n",
    "3.  Go back to your Task 1 output. Carefully copy the entire **Base64 encoded Public Key**.\n",
    "4.  Paste this Public Key into the \"Recipient's Public Key (Base64)\" text area in Task 2.\n",
    "5.  Type a message you want to encrypt in the \"Plaintext Message\" area.\n",
    "6.  Click the \"Encrypt Message\" button.\n",
    "7.  Observe the three Base64 encoded outputs: \"Encapsulated Key,\" \"Nonce,\" and \"Encrypted Message.\"\n",
    "8.  Read the status messages to follow the steps the code is performing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The three Base64 encoded strings generated in this task (`Encapsulated Key`, `Nonce`, and `Encrypted Message`) are what you would typically transmit to the recipient over an insecure channel. In **Task 3**, you will play the role of the recipient and use these three pieces of information, along with the **private key** from Task 1, to decrypt the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to copy these three values accurately for Task 3!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Now, run the code cell below to perform Task 2.**"
